# VersionatorTest

This is a test package which uses the Versionator plugin to embed a version number into the executable in a way that's accessible at runtime.

Xcode currently seems to have trouble running this plugin, but it works fine from the command line. Just do:

`swift run`

to build & run this executable.

Doing so should fetch, build & run the plugin as part of the build process.

See https://github.com/elegantchaos/Versionator for the plugin itself.
